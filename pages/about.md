## About the Collection

This Digital Exhibit commemorates the 60 years of the UP School of Library and Information Studies. It highlights some of the people and events that have been part of the institution.
We encourage you to browse the collection and celebrate this important milestone with us.
If you have some UP SLIS memorabilia that you want to share with us, you may submit your digital material through: [UP SLIS iRemember](http://upslis.info/iremember)
